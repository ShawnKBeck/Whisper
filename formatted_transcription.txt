Interview makes me nervous.\nI don't like talking about myself.\nI like talking about life principles or products Gotcha, but when it comes to me, it's not something I'm the best at so just throw that out there and keep that in mind Okay, no worries.\nAll right, cool.\nThis is a conversation The thing is that it'll be just like what we chat.\nI mean, it'll just be conversation We're not gonna hot seat you on anything right now.\nSo She already has yep, we're gonna go to record it really just so we don't remember every word You've got a great quote we pull out later Carl you want to kick it off and then well, well, I just was curious because I know I believe it was Natalie Baird who introduced You to Jerry Foster.\nYes, and then Jerry Foster Sent me your information Is it was it Natalie that you know, or yes, how do you know Natalie?\nNatalie is dating a high school friend of mine.\nOh We've been friends for a while and I ran them into them at Aldi and I had run Shabana that day and Shabana has a grocery store.\nThat was recently deserted And I'd noticed the grocery store and how creepy it was because it looks like somebody just left yesterday like it's fully stacked This is probably last summer last fall And she was like, well, what are you doing in Shabana and I was like, well I just ran all the roads and we started the story and telling her how I had changed my perspective on the county and all that kind of thing and She's like you have to meet Jerry Foster so I met Jerry Foster and Jerry Foster is amazing and He grew up in Lee and I lived in Lee a little bit as a kid for like maybe four months But uh, we had a and I talked to Jerry I guess this is not at all uncommon I think we talked for two hours over lunch but he's an amazing guy and Yeah, so here I am.\nWell, I just want to say thank you For being a part of the magazine and even though it is a little uncomfortable if we appreciate it and we're we're happy to have you Well, thank you Yeah, so at this point Dana and I will pepper you with questions and go long on these don't worry about like Filling it with one sentence catch-off is going too long.\nBut Dana, what are you thinking?\nWell, I guess let's begin at the beginning, right?\nHow did this whole?\nHow did running start?\nHave you like was was running something you've done in the past before this project or?\nsure so Running started because I was quitting smoking.\nI was like a three-pack-a-day smoker and I decided I think Would have been 2018 I'd read something.\nI think it might have been atomic habits I'd read something that said I tried to quit smoking many many times over the years and something had driven in the idea that I Had to become a different kind of person to quit smoking.\nI couldn't be the same kind of person and just not smoke you know, so I just I Picked something and I decided to become a runner because in my mind runners are disciplines and healthy So I did couch to 5k Thinking that would help me quit smoking and I hated running so I would never do it again after that but It helped me quit smoking.\nI became addicted to running and so, okay.\nYeah So Walk me through kind of how that so couch to 5k.\nHow did you progress?\nSo I did the usual I think couch to 5k and then I ran my 5k and then I moved on to Like a marathon.\nOh, I got hurt.\nI didn't make it to the marathon Okay, but I think that's the usual like people do a 5k at the laser jumper in the marathon training so I learned the hard way and I had an IT bandage you and I had to go back and kind of start over and take it slower the next time around but I've run a few marathons I did like a 50 miler in the fall a bunch of 10 K's and 5 K's It's become a big part of my life And I ask because I'm the part that fascinates me the most is that couch to 5k portion like how you do that Like what's involved in that?\nWhat are the steps?\nOkay.\nSo the steps are download an application called couch to 5k and You run three times a week it starts it's a run to walk then so the first week I think it's you walk a minute and a half and run a minute and then as the program goes on over the course of nine weeks You get up to running for a full half an hour, which is usually half That gradually builds you up So It sounds like you were expecting going into this that I'm gonna do this, but I'm gonna hate it So then I'm just gonna do this and never do it again And then you ended up addicted to running what did that surprise you?\nYeah, I mean Yes, and no like I have kind of an addictive personality.\nSo like it's not totally shocking Okay, that would happen.\nBut I mean I certainly like the first time I ran couch to 5k like I was a three pack a day smoker and Like it was very challenging to run You know half a mile that I ran but By the end of it.\nI had I didn't have any long issues left by the end of that.\nSo Yeah, it was not Not what I expected, but it wasn't totally shocking.\nOkay, so this moment is like, huh?\nI don't hate this Yeah, I never thought it would be fun and I certainly never thought that's really surprising to me that like it's not It's an opportunity And this is something I'd kind of come to anyway because I've had a lot of life changes I look at it as an opportunity to practice with this comfort and I'd always thought it would be painful But it's not and there's a difference between painting this comfort You know Like it really helps I can apply it to pretty much every other aspect of my life that when I'm running As long as I stay as long as it stays uncomfortable not painful like it's good You know, that's one of those things that you explore as you do it like it should this feel that way You know should this hurt is that something I should be concerned about if it's a sharp pain it probably you should be concerned about but if it's you know, you're Are having issues like getting breath and you know, that's normal, you know, so it does that make sense?\nYeah Hey, I Want to date a little bit further.\nI know there's more to the story You make it sound easy and maybe looking back it was But you know the discipline I've tried to couch to 5k and I've done that and I think my wife anyway, it doesn't matter What drove you to keep going?\nThat's a good question the fact that and one of the things I learned through this process and not that this Isolated outside of everything else, but during this time like it It was a learning process, you know, I've come to understand that discipline is something that's practiced, you know I don't think most maybe some people are born disciplined I don't think so like they probably learned it somewhere along the line and the fact that I can learn to be disciplined is Gives me a lot of hope in certain areas like, you know, I don't have to be a slob, you know There's hope there but Yeah That's one of the things that I was actively thinking about I was doing is like I'm really doing this and like if I can Do this what else I can't learn to do, you know, it's good.\nI always thought discipline was kind of like this This thing that you were born with that was innate and through this I've come to understand that that's definitely not true Is that it I answer your question?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah, that's perfect.\nSo Yeah, that applies to a lot of things.\nThere's a lot of if you scale that, you know, like that you kind of become whatever you do repeatedly and The options and the limits don't really exist, you know, yeah, and they've taught me that If you're like what let's I think she's gonna explore So what are some of those other like once you kind of break broke through that mental block of realizing that you could be disciplined Where else in your life?\nDid you start applying that and you find that you could also change other parts of your life besides just the smoking so Currently work in sales.\nMm-hmm.\nAll right, and the way I came across the sales job was I have a friend who is aware of my running every road in the county thing and Wanting to practice with this comfort.\nSo he approached me and said hey, I'm taking a sales manager job and I have an opportunity for you to continue to practice with this comfort and Explore the county and do both those things which prospecting Describing but and it's worked out that way so I I've always had a crippling fear of public speaking and through this I've gotten a lot better with it.\nIt's forced me to work on my interpersonal skills.\nIt's forced me to become a better conversationalist But our listener those are things that I Didn't think I was really capable of But just through practice, right, you know, you kind of get better at anything I've come to I'm sure there's things that that's not true for but And it turned into another one of those things that huh?\nI don't hate this.\nI thought this would be a lot worse Yeah, I've been doing that for a year and a half and it's been a really good vehicle for growth in ways that I couldn't Have seen both financially, but mostly\n
